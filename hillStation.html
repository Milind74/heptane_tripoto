    <p>A hot cup of tea while admiring a gorgeous sunset in the midst of lush mountains is what a perfect holiday is made of. If you enjoy being in the midst of nature and don't leave any chance to get away from the drudgery of cities then this travel guide is for you.</p>
  <p>Hill stations promise quiet days, surreal views, starlit nights, delicious food and a tryst with nature but most importantly a vacation in a hill station takes you away from concrete buildings and gives you a chance to experience the joys of simple living.</p>  
<p>At the same time, if you are an adventure lover, you'll enjoy travelling to the hill stations in India even more. Trekking, hiking, mountain biking, river rafting and rock climbing are some of the activities that all hill stations offer. But even for those who don't enjoy adventure, a walk through long winding roads amidst pine trees cures everything.</p> 
<h4>All You Need To Know About Hill Stations</h4><br>
<p> 

  To plan a stress-free vacation, the one thing that makes all the difference is the best time to go. If you plan your vacation to hill stations during monsoon, be prepared for delays, landslides, relentless rain and spoilt plans. The best time to head to hill stations is either during summer or winter. 
  
   
  
  The most important thing to remember when planning a trip to hill stations in India is respecting the mountains and the local culture. Every town has its own set of rules and as a responsible traveller, you must respect these norms and guidelines.

  <li>Don't drive if you aren't familiar with hill roads and the technique of hill driving</li>
  <li>Always take warm clothes irrespective of the season you are travelling in</li>
  <li>Carry your own water bottle so you don't have to keep buying one-time use bottles</li>
  <li>Shop from the local markets so you can encourage the local economy</li>
  <li>Always listen to locals, especially with respect to trekking routes, weather forecast and local flora and fauna</li>
 <br> <h4>What to Pack for Your Trip to Hill Stations?</h4><br>
  <p>Believe it or not, but packing is one of the most important things to take care of when planning a trip to hill stations. The amenities available in hill stations in India may differ from what you are used to in the city. This holds true especially if you are travelling to remote areas. From medicines, basic first aid, snacks to torches, chargers and warm clothes – make sure your packing list is comprehensive.</p>

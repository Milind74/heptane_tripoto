            <h1>Rajasthan Highlights</h1>
            <p>All trips to Rajasthan must begin with a visit to its bustling capital. An apt introduction to the vibrant state, Jaipur or the ‘pink city’ is as charming as it is welcoming. Home to majestic forts, grand hotels and small bazaars – Jaipur is gradually becoming a cosmopolitan with the traditional charms of an old town. It’s an ideal weekend destination from the capital city of Delhi and is a perfect start for those who are on a tour of Rajasthan. Rajasthan tour packages include a trip to all of Jaipur’s marvels including Amber Palace, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, Chokhi Dhani, Nahargarh Fort and Jaigarh Fort. While the 16th century Amber Palace is gorgeous by day, its beauty is even more breathtaking as the sun sets. If your schedule allows, you must include the light and sound show at Amber in your Rajasthan tour packages. Jaipur is also an ideal shopping destination with its lively bazaars including Johari Bazaar for jewellery, Chandpole Bazaar for handicrafts and Hawa Mahal market for small knick-knacks. If, on the other hand, delicious food is what makes your vacation memorable, Jaipur is going to be your favourite place in Rajasthan. Besides the incredibly delicious pyaaz kachori, you must also try laal maas and handi chicken in one of the local restaurants. <br>

 

                Pushkar is another destination which is gradually finding its place in Rajasthan tour packages. Primarily popular as a holy place for Hindus, it is now loved by travellers from across the world for its enthralling bazaars, picturesque ghats, backpacker hostels and an old world charm. Travellers from across the world visit Pushkar during the popular Pushkar Fair which is typically held in December. If you plan to visit Pushkar during the festival, it’s best to book Rajasthan tour packages well in advance since accommodation in the small town tends to get expensive. Located about 15km away from Pushkar is the popular city of Ajmer which is a huge part of Rajasthan tour packages. Known world over for the revered Khwaja Gharib Nawaz or Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Ajmer makes for a great day trip if you are on your way to Pushkar or Jodhpur.<br>
                
                 
                
                Of course, all Rajasthan tour packages are incomplete without a visit to the Blue City of Jodhpur. Fondly known as the ‘Gateway to Thar’, Jodhpur is most popular for blue-hued houses and the magnificent Mehrangarh Fort. Counted among the largest forts in India, Mehrangarh was built in the year 1459. The fort has served as a backdrop in many Hollywood and Bollywood movies and this is a big reason why it has become a must visit in all Rajasthan tour packages. Jodhpur is also home to the stunning Umaid Bhawan Palace, which has been restored into a hotel and museum besides serving as the residence of the royal family. Head here for a tour of the museum which offers a peek into the bygone era through a rich collection of photographs, paintings and artefacts.<br>
                
                 
                
                The Golden City of Jaisalmer is an awe-inspiring destination and a huge draw for tourists who are looking to book Rajasthan tour packages. Offering a journey through picturesque sand dunes, majestic forts and rustic villages, Jaisalmer has all that is needed to satisfy your travel appetite.<br>
                
                 
                
                One of the most sought-after destinations in Rajasthan tour packages, the city is located in the heart of Thar Desert and in proximity to the Pakistan border. The first glimpse of Jaisalmer is of the spellbinding Jaisalmer Fort which stands tall as a proud symbol for the city. Home to a number of museums and small, forgotten havelis, the city is a treasure for history enthusiasts. If you are travelling with little ones, Akal Wood Fossil Park is a must visit. Taking you back in time to 180 million years ago, the park has interesting exhibits including 25 petrified tree trunks, petrophyllum, equisetitis and ptyllophyllum species of the early Jurassic period. However, what attracts travellers most is camping amidst dreamy sand dunes. A huge part of all Rajasthan tour packages, camping in Jaisalmer gives travellers a chance to disconnect from the chaos and take in the peace and beauty of awe-inspiring sand dunes. You can book customised Rajasthan tour packages focussed on camping which will also include enthralling cultural shows, traditional dances, a lavish feast of local cuisine and of course the bumpy but unmissable camel safari.<br>
                
                 
                
                Rajasthan is a fine example of natural abundance, man-made marvels, culture and tradition. Of the numerous must-visit cities in Rajasthan, Udaipur is loved by all travellers and receives special attention in Rajasthan tour packages, owing to its unforgettable views. Referred to as the City of Lakes, Udaipur has it all – lakes, mountains and majestic palaces. From boating in Lake Pichola, shopping in local markets, sipping coffee at artsy, boho cafes to marvelling at the architecture of the City Palace, a visit to Udaipur will make it clear as to why the city is a favourite with travellers. Although boating, shopping and palace tours are a must in Udaipur, one should definitely include the Dharohar Dance Show at Bagore Ki Haweli in Rajasthan tour packages. The cultural show offers a glimpse of Rajasthan’s unmatched talent and also gives one a glimpse into the state’s rich heritage and culture.</p>

         <h1>Rajasthan Local Cuisine</h1>
         <p>An integral part of Rajasthan’s rich culture is its delectable cuisine. Spicy and flavoursome, Rajasthani cuisine is a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Since Rajasthan is situated in an arid region, the food comprises of dishes that can be shelved for a long time and requires minimum water or fresh vegetables. A few examples are bajra ki roti, lehsun ki chutney and mogar ki puri.

 

            Rajasthan’s spicy laal maas is also popular across the country. It’s a tender mutton curry cooked in a thick, creamy tomato base. Vegetarians must try dal bati churma and ker sangri. Dal bati is made of crunchy batis which are dipped in ghee and eaten had with sweet churma.</p>
